            Eating and drinking is an essential part of everyday life. And yet, there are many people in the world today
            who rely on others to feed them. In this work, we present a prototype robot-assisted self-feeding system for individuals
            with movement disorders. The system is capable of perceiving, localizing, grasping, and delivering non-compliant food items
            to an individual. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We trained an object recognition network to detect specific food items, and we compute the grasp
            pose for each item. Human input is obtained through an interface consisting of an eye-tracker and a display screen. The
            human selects options on the monitor with their eye and head movements and triggers responses with mouth movements. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We performed a pilot study with five able-bodied participants and five participants with a spinal cord injuries (SCI) to evaluate
            the performance of our prototype system. Participants selected food items with their eye movements, which were then delivered
            by the robot.
          </p>
          <p>
            We observed an average overall feeding success rate of 91.6% and an average overall task time of 34.2 ± 4.0
            seconds per food item. The SCI participants gave scores of 83.1 and 13.6 on the System Usability Scale and NASA Task
            Load Index, respectively. We also conducted a custom, post-study interview to gather participant feedback to drive future
            design decisions.

          The overall goal of our research is to enable people with disabilities to live productive and healthy lifestyles.
          The goal of this work was to develop a robotic platform for helping people with spinal cord injuries
          to perform tasks of everyday living, with a primary emphasis on feeding.
          <br>
          <br>
          We began by developing a prototype robot-assisted feeding system. The system consisted primarily of a <b>Baxter Research Robot</b> 
          from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rethinkrobotics.com">Rethink Robotics</a> positioned across the table from the user. 
          The person sits in their powered wheelchair, equipped with a monitor and a <a target="_blank" href="https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/">Tobii Eye Tracker 5</a>. 
          An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intelrealsense.com/lidar-camera-l515/">Intel L515 depth camera</a> is mounted to the wrist 
          of the robot to handle perception, and the user communicates their intention to the system using their eye movements. 
          <em>This initial protoype was our 'Version 1' robot-assisted feeding device, or <b>'<span class="dperact">RAFv1</span>'</b></em>.

        <p>
          To detect food items on a plate, we trained a <a targer="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf">mask R-CNN</a> object detection network to recognize symmetric, non-compliant food items 
          such as carrots, pretzels, and celery. We used the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2">Detectron2</a> 
          framework for object detection implementation. We used  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag">AprilTag</a> fiducial markers to register the coordinate frame for the scene and computed 
          the grasp pose for food item acquisition.

                 alt="Interpolate start reference image." />
             We developed a custom graphical user interface (GUI) which facilitates bi-directional communication between 
             the user and the system. The GUI primarily displays the output of the depth camera attached to the robot 
             overlaid with detections from the mask R-CNN inference. The person uses their eyes to control a dwell-time cursor 
             to make selections on the screen. When the cursor enters the bounding box of a selectable food item, it will highlight 
             to indicate its interactivity. If the cursor remains in the box for 1.5 s, the item is selected. The primary benefit 
             of this setup is that users are in control over the most important decisions of the feeding task: what to eat and when to eat it. 
             We used <a target="_blank" href="https://talonvoice.com">Talon Voice</a> as the communication layer between the user and the GUI.

                 alt="Interpolate start reference image." />
                 To detect the user's facial keypoints, we used the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment">face-alignment</a> python package. 
                 This package detects 60 facial landmarks, 12 of which belong to the mouth. We fit an ellipse 
                 to those 12 mouth landmarks by minimizing a least-squares cost function. By comparing the ratio 
                 of the principal axes of the ellipse to a threshold, we can get a good indication of whether the 
                 mouth is open or closed. By opening their mouth, the user indicates when they are ready to eat. 
                 This gives the person additional control over the pacing of the feeding task.

            In this work, we conducted a pilot study in which we presented the system to individuals 
            with spinal cord injuries and other mobility impairments. People were able to try out the 
            system, practice feeding themselves, and discover critical failure modes. The goal was to 
            develop a baseline for system performance as well as to capture human experience when using 
            the device. Five able-bodied individuals (2 male, 3 female; 25 ± 4.3 years old) and five 
            people with spinal cord injury or other movement disorders (3 male, 2 female, 48 ± 13.3 
            years old) participated in the study.
            <br>
            <br>
            To evaluate system performance, we measured both success rates and task times for each of the 
            study phases. After data collection, we had participants complete the <a target="_blank" href="https://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/groups/TLX/">NASA Task Load Index 
            (TLX)</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html">System Usability Scale (SUS)</a>. To better understand the needs of the disability 
            community, we gathered qualitative feedback from participants in the form of a custom, 
            semi-structured, post-study interview.
            <br>
            <br>
            We observed an average overall feeding success rate of 91.6% and an average overall task time of 34.2 ± 4.0
            seconds per food item. The SCI participants gave scores of 83.1 and 13.6 on the SUS and TLX
            , respectively, indicating excellent perceived usefullness and low to medium effort required to complete the task.

            The feedback gathered from participants in the pilot study directly informed the design 
            in the next phase of device development. The primary goals of the next iteration of the system, 
            dubbed <b>'<span class="dperact">RAFv2</span>'</b>, were to work towards a fully portable 
            system contained on a wheelchair with upgraded vision and motion planning capabilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <span class="dperact">RAFv2</span> system features a <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen3-robots">Kinova Gen3 robot</a> with integrated 
            vision system mounted onto a powered wheelchair. A tablet monitor equipped with an eye tracker 
            is mounted on the chair as well. An additional component is an <a target="_blank"

        <p>
            To interact with more food items, we expanded our object detection dataset to include 
            additional items. We continued to use the Mask R-CNN model in the previous device iteration, 
            but fine-tuned the model to include images of scoopable and skewerable food items in addition 
            to graspable items. Graspable items included pretzels, carrots, and celery. Skewerable items 
            included strawberry, watermelon, and banana. Scoopable items included yogurt, cottage cheese, 
            and beans. In addition to food items, we also included other dining objects such as plates, 
            cups, bowls, forks, spoons, and knives, with a total of 16 classes in our new model.

        <!-- <br> -->
        </div>
        <p>
            In the previous prototype, the robot had to view the food item from overhead to compute 
            the grasp pose, while simultaneously viewing the AR tag. This resulted in both a restrictive 
            motion planning process as well as a clunky system operation. The addition of the second 
            depth camera provided a constant RGB-D data stream to increase the system's perception 
            potential. While the robot's arm camera is monitoring food items and has a low field of view, 
            the scene camera is monitoring collision objects and other scene-related items. The point 
            clouds of each camera stream can be stitched together to build an overall scene environment. 
            Additionally, we implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://moveit.ros.org">
            MoveIt Motion Planning Library</a> to plan collision-free motions with the robot. The video 
            below shows an example of a collision-free motion plan using MoveIt's perception pipeline.

        <h3 class="title is-4"><span class="dperact">RAFv2</span> - Visual Servoing</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <!-- <br> -->
        </div>
        <p>
            In the initial prototype pilot study, we defined set positions for the food item handoff 
            point. During the post-study interviews, participants mentioned they thought it would 
            be a good idea if the robot could track the person's mouth position to adjust the 
            handoff point as needed. To implement this feature, we used visual servoing to continually 
            adjust the pose of the robot based on the position of the user's mouth. The desired camera 
            pose was defined as a simple offset (~20 cm) in the z-direction from the mouth pose towards 
            the camera. This results in the robot hovering in front of the user's face, tracking the mouth 
            as the user moves. To implement visual servoing, we used the open-source <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://visp.inria.fr">Visual Servoing Platform Library (ViSP)</a>.

            In this work, we present the design and development of our prototype robot-assisted feeding 
            system and the results of our initial pilot study with members of the SCI community. We also 
            present our second device iteration incorporating upgrades targetted toward a general purpose 
            robotic assistance platform for performing activities of daily living. While there is 
            significant work to be done to transition this technology toward a usable product, this work 
            represents a significant step toward in-home robotic assistance platforms for people with 
            spinal cord injury and other mobility impairments.
